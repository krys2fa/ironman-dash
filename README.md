# ironman-dash
This project consists of building an endless runner video game using JavaScript and the Phaser game engine as a requirement for the Microverse JavaScript Capstone Project.
It is inspired by the simplicity of [Google's T-Rex Dino Game](http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/)

## Game Design Document

### Background
>This endless runner game is built purely on the inspiration and simplicity of [Google's T-Rex Dino Game](http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/) which can be played in Google Chrome in offline mode.

### Story
>Ironman is a popular comic/movie hero in the Marvel Comic/Cinematic Universe. In this universe, Tony Stark is a billionaire who invents a metallic suit which can do almost anything from flying to shooting energy from his palms.

>I employ Ironman in this game purely to dash (hence the name) and jump over platforms as quickly as he can to his laboratory to fix his suit which can no longer fly :wink:.

>He has to avoid blue fireballs that appear randomly on platforms or get burnt and fall to his death in the process. Also he falls to his death if he misses a platform whiles jumping.

>To make it a bit more interesting, he can jump one more time while in the air in case he mis-times a jump.

### Game Development Schedule
>In order to meet the time estimate of 5 days for this project, I planned and went with the following daily schedule:

>Day 1
I read materials on the Phaser game engine and practiced with tutorials that were made available.

>Day 2
I conceptualized the idea for the game and put together the working Game Design Document (GDD) for the project.
I also used this time to gather resources and assets necessary for developing the game.

>Day 3
I started creating the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) version of the game.
This had to do with setting up the project directory, installing dependencies and starting to implement the core features of the game.

>Day 4
With an MVP project setup from the previous day, I went on to refine most of the work. This included everything from refactoring code to fixing linter errors to writing tests.

>Day 5
Day 5 was a bit demanding because I was determined to meet the time estimate set for the project. I deployed the game to Netlify and created a Pull Request for the project on GitHub.
Deployment took much longer than necessary because there were challenges in building the production files as well as challenges with the size of some assets.
With this taken care of, I went on to submit the project for review.

>#### Ironman

## How to Play

All you need is the main mouse button (left button). The game starts with Ironman running towards his laboratory. Help him jump onto platforms to avoid falling to his death. You may want to avoid the blue fireballs too as his suit can no longer help him fly or avoid getting burnt.
Don't worry, he still has an extra jump (left-click once more while he is in the air) in case he mis-times a jump.
