# ironman-dash
This project consists of building an endless runner video game using JavaScript and the Phaser game engine as a requirement for the Microverse JavaScript Capstone Project.
It is inspired by the simplicity of [Google's T-Rex Dino Game](http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/)

## Built With

- Javascript
- Html
- CSS
- [Phaser](https://phaser.io).

## Game Development Design

Click [here](src/assets/docs/gdd.md) to see the Game Design Document for the game.

## How to Play

All you need is the main mouse button (left button). The game starts with Ironman running towards his laboratory. Help him jump onto platforms to avoid falling to his death. You may want to avoid the blue fireballs too as his suit can no longer help him fly or avoid getting burnt.
Don't worry, he still has an extra jump (left-click once more while he is in the air) in case he mis-times a jump.
