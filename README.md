# ironman-dash
This project consists of building an endless runner video game using JavaScript and the Phaser game engine as a requirement for the Microverse JavaScript Capstone Project.
It is inspired by the simplicity of [Google's T-Rex Dino Game](http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/)

## Story
Ironman is a popular comic/movie hero in the Marvel Comic/Cinematic Universe. In this universe, Tony Stark is a billionaire who invents a metallic suit which can do almost anything from flying to shooting energy from his palms.

I employ Ironman in this game purely to dash (hence the name) and jump over platforms as quickly as he can to his laboratory to fix his suit which can no longer fly :wink:.

He has to avoid blue fireballs that appear randomly on platforms or get burnt and fall to his death in the process. Also he falls to his death if he misses a platform whiles jumping.

To make it a bit more interesting, he can jump one more time while in the air in case he mis-times a jump.

## Key Assets/Images

### Platforms
| Image           | Description    |
| :------------- | :----------: |
|![](./src/assets/game/platform.png) | You can run and jump on these |



### Ironman

| Image           | Description    |
| :------------- | :----------: |
|![](./src/assets/screenshots/ironman.png) | The main (and only) character in the game. He can do an extra jump in the air in case he gets into a fix :wink: |


### Fireball

## How to Play

All you need is the main mouse button (left button). The game starts with Ironman running towards his laboratory. Help him jump onto platforms to avoid falling to his death. You may want to avoid the blue fireballs too as his suit can no longer help him fly or avoid getting burnt.
Don't worry, he still has an extra jump (left-click once more while he is in the air) in case he mis-times a jump.
