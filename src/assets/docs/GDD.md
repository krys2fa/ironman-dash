#Game Design Document for Ironman Dash

## Background
This endless runner game is built purely on the inspiration and simplicity of [Google's T-Rex Dino Game](http://www.trex-game.skipser.com/) which can be played in Google Chrome in offline mode.

## Story
Ironman is a popular comic/movie hero in the Marvel Comic/Cinematic Universe. In this universe, Tony Stark is a billionaire who invents a metallic suit which can do almost anything from flying to shooting energy from his palms.

I employ Ironman in this game purely to dash (hence the name) and jump over platforms as quickly as he can to his laboratory to fix his suit which can no longer fly :wink:.

He has to avoid blue fireballs that appear randomly on platforms or get burnt and fall to his death in the process. Also he falls to his death if he misses a platform whiles jumping.

To make it a bit more interesting, he can jump one more time while in the air in case he mis-times a jump.
